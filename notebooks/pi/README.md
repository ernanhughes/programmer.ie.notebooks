# Pi Agents — Jupyter notebook companions

One executable Jupyter notebook per chapter of *Pi Agents*: `01-chapter.ipynb`
through `44-chapter.ipynb` (42 chapters plus Appendices A and B).

A notebook exists to move you from a chapter to a concrete question: run or
inspect an experiment, change an input, and see what the result establishes. It
demonstrates **its own** chapter — it does not repeat the prose and it does not
run a generic example.

## What the notebooks are

| Thing | What it is |
|---|---|
| Kernel | **Python 3** — presents, tables, checks, orchestrates |
| Pi | **Node/TypeScript**, called through the real pinned packages |
| Model | **scripted** (`faux`) — no network, no credential, no cost |
| Authority | `examples/node_modules/@earendil-works/*` at **1.0.4** (`declarations` beat prose) |
| Claim ledger | `examples/evidence.json` — the book's `claim_class` × `evidence_scope` |
| Published experiences | `/tools/ai/pi/31-chapter/` and `39-chapter/` — the two browser replays, inspected as *recorded* evidence |

**There is no Python re-implementation of Pi's loop, context loader, session
projection, permissions or protocol anywhere in this set.** Every Pi rule that
appears is demonstrated by the book's own code under `examples/`, called through
Node. Python only orchestrates, formats and asserts.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why | Check |
|---|---|---|
| **Python 3.11+** | The notebooks' kernel | `python --version` |
| **Node.js 22.19+** | Type-stripping runs the examples directly | `node --version` |
| **pinned npm packages** | `@earendil-works/pi-*` at **1.0.4** | `cd examples && npm ci` |
| A POSIX shell (`bash`) where noted | ch 9, 14 — shell/exit-code rows | `bash --version` |

## Install

```bash
cd examples
npm ci            # the pinned pi-ai / pi-agent-core / pi-coding-agent @ 1.0.4
cd ..
python -m pip install -r notebooks/pi/requirements.txt
```

The Node packages come from the book's existing pin and lockfile. The Python
side is deliberately minimal: `nbformat`, `nbclient`, `ipykernel` and friends.
There is no plotting or dataframe library, because nothing in the set needs one.

## Run a notebook

Any notebook server works — `jupyter lab`, `jupyter notebook`, VS Code. A
notebook runs correctly with the working directory set either to
`notebooks/pi/` or to the repository root; `pinb.py` finds the repo from the
marker (an ancestor containing `content/books/pi/` *and*
`examples/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`). Override with
`PIN_REPO`; `PIN_NOTEBOOKS` overrides the notebook directory.

Run the cells top to bottom in a fresh kernel. Nothing depends on cells executed
out of order; the setup cell in every notebook checks the pin and the ledger.

### Executing the whole set from a fresh kernel (the way the reports were made)

```bash
python notebooks/pi/tools/build.py       # writes every NN-chapter.ipynb
python notebooks/pi/tools/execute.py     # fresh kernel, allow_errors=False, saves outputs
```

`execute.py` prints one line per notebook and `N/N notebooks PASSED`. If a driver
fails, fix the driver; if an assertion fails, check whether the assertion or the
expectation was wrong — never weaken an assertion to make it pass, and never
change a chapter to fit output.

## The chapter index

### Execution modes

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Run** | The pinned runtime is executed (the chapter's example or a notebook driver calling the same packages and harness). Output is from this execution. |
| **Inspect/reproduce** | Preserved evidence is read and a result derived/checked from it. The artifact's version and provenance are named. A recording is never presented as a current run. |
| **Demonstrate** | A deterministic illustration of a pattern **this book proposes**, clearly labelled. Chapter 30 is the only chapter in this category. |
| **Manual/optional live** | Needs a terminal, container, credential or real model. Written as a checklist; reported **NOT RUN** unless actually run. |

## Evidence limitations

- **The model is scripted everywhere.** A notebook shows that the code *around* a
  model is correct — never how a real model behaves. Request counts are exact for
  the scripted control flow only.
- **Recorded ≠ fresh.** The published browser experiences (ch 31, 39) were
  captured on **Pi 1.0.2** and stay labelled 1.0.2. The notebooks regenerate a
  *fresh* 1.0.4 trace from the chapter's own exporters, and inspect the old
  recording (when present) as historical.
- **`real_model` scope is empty.** The book has no accepted real-model evidence.
  Optional live sections, if added by a reader, must be explicitly enabled
  (`PIN_LIVE=1`), state prerequisites and cost, and take credentials from the
  environment — never from a cell.
- **Documented-not-run stays documented-not-run.** Anything marked
  `documented-not-run` in the book (e.g. `registerToolRenderer`, `onPayload`) is
  not executed here.
- **Containers and micro-VMs are not containment evidence.** Chapter 42 labels
  them unrun unless actually exercised; a schematic sandbox is not a proof.
